	dcterms:description """The Monitoring-Automation Interface Description (MAID) is an abstract definition of


1. a timeseries to be monitored

2. desired normalizations of that timeseries

3. a set of condition->event mappings to apply to the timeseries or its normalizations


 These time series definitions can be parameterized for more flexibility. Usually each MAID should describe 
exactly one raw timeseries. Depending of the type of monitoring or event management system connected to 
the engine, the corresponding adapter may choose to either supply the raw timeseries itself or directly 
create issues using the contained Event structures if it the raw data is not available.


The abstract MAID definitions are then mapped to the MARS model within the engine using so-called \"Binding Blocks\".


Thus MAID ensures that the arago Automation Engine is compatible to any monitoring system and can fully interact 
with them. By formalizing the interface the information verification process and definition of required add-ons 
to the monitoring systems becomes possible.""";
