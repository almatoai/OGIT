	dcterms:description "If (oc:responsibleFor oc:Agent-Generic oc:Situation) holds at time 't', this means that, sometime prior to time 't' the oc:Agent-Generic deliberately performed an action which was instrumental in bringing about the oc:Situation to the extent that, other things being equal, if the action had not been performed, the oc:Situation would not have come about. This sense of 'responsibility' is stronger than causal responsibility, i.e., it requires that the oc:Agent-Generic play more than an unwitting causal role in bringing about the oc:Situation. However, it is probably weaker than full-blown moral responsibility, since even though the oc:Agent-Generic intended to perform the action which brought about the oc:Situation, the oc:Agent-Generic might not have intended to bring about the oc:Situation.";
