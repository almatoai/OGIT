	dcterms:description "An oc:AbstractInformationStructure is a specialization of oc:AbstractStructure. Each instance of oc:AbstractInformationStructure is an abstract individual comprising abstract symbols and relations between them. Important specializations of this collection include oc:CharacterString and oc:Sentence. The OpenCyc concept oc:AbstractInformationStructure also includes abstract diagrams, graphs, and bit strings. The collection can be more precisely defined as follows: Each oc:AbstractInformationStructure is such that each of its physical instantiations consists of instantiations of instances of oc:AtomicSymbol-Abstract, arranged in a certain way. For example, the abstract sentence 'The pig flies' is an oc:AbstractInformationStructure. Each written instantiation of it consists of an instantiation of the words (symbols) 'The', 'pig' and 'flies', written in that order. (If the oc:AbstractInformationStructure 'The pig flies' were spoken, the same words would appear in the same order, i.e. 'The' first, etc., but the sequence would be determined by the arrangement of the spoken words in time, rather than space.) Likewise with abstract diagrams, graphs, etc. Each of these is such that its physical instantiations consist of arrangements of instantiations of instances of oc:AtomicSymbol-Abstract. A hard copy of a wiring diagram consists of a group of concrete symbols representing various circuit components, in which these symbols are spatially arranged in a certain in way. The arrangement of the concrete symbols in an instantiation of an oc:AbstractInformationStructure is not always a simple matter of arrangement in space or time. The sequence of symbols '0010010111011001' can be instantiated in written, spoken, or electronic forms. In the last case, the order of the symbols is determined by conventions concerning the electronic medium in which it is stored, rather than by any common criterion for precedence or subsequence in space or time.";
