	dcterms:description """Viewpoint is used to denote how a set of resources, or an individual resource, is relevant to a context of use. The term \"viewpoint\" is adopted from the ISO RM-ODP specifications and its more recent use in enterprise architecture descriptions. The RM-ODP introducesd the concept of viewpoint to describe a system from a particular set of concerns. RM-ODP defines five viewpoints. Together they provide a complete description of a system: enterprise viewpoint, information viewpoint, computational viewpoint, engineering viewpoint, and technology viewpoint.  In VAEM, \"Viewpoint\" is used as a dimension for characterizing an ontology graph.  The viewpoints of an ontology may not always correpsond directly to those of a system but the idea of describing a subject area of interest from distinct viewpoints is still relevant. A viewpoint can be further distinguished by \"aspects\". For example the \"information viewpoint\" of an application can be partitioned into separate graphs for the \"security\", \"operational\" and\"data retention\" aspects.""";
