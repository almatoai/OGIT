	dcterms:description """
<p>This class is used to represent <em>fact tables</em>.</p>

<p>Consider the work performed on a project.
Work may be analyzed according to attributes such as who performed the work,
the task or activity that the work accomplished,
when the work was performed, etc.
These attributes are referred to as <em>dimensions</em>.</p>

<p>Work may be quantified by such metrics as its effort in person-hours,
its cost in some currency, its duration in months, its peak staffing, etc.
These quantities are referred to as <em>measures</em>.</p>

<p>The term dimension is used because the measures can be regarded as occupying cells
in a multi-dimensional array (sometimes referred to as a <em>datacube</em>).
It is frequently of interest to summarize the measures along a dimension,
for example given the effort by activity, calculate the total effort for all activities.
Conversely, given the total effort, it may be of interest to see how it is broken down by activity.</p>

<p>In general, set of related measures, analyzed along a set of dimensions may be organized into a
<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_table\">fact table</a>.
Each row of a fact table contains a set of measures (e.g. effort and cost)
for a given combination of dimension values (e.g. activity and month).</p>

<p>This resource MAY contain the actual measurements,
provide a link to the source of the actual measurements,
or contain both a link to the source and a copy of the actual measurements obtained from the source
(i.e. a cached copy of the source).</p>""";
