	dcterms:description "The itil:EventManagement is the process responsible for managing itil:Event(s) throughout their lifecycle. The itil:EventManagement process is one of the main activities of IT operations. The itil:EventManagement process monitors all itil:Event(s) that occur throughout the IT infrastructure, to monitor normal operation and to detect and escalate exception conditions. The itil:EventManagement process is the basis for operational monitoring and control. In addition, if the itil:Event(s) are programmed to communicate operational information as well as warnings and exceptions, they can be used as a basis for automating many routine operations management activities, for example executing scripts on remote devices, or submitting jobs for processing, or even dynamically balancing the demand for a service across multiple devices to enhance performance. The itil:EventManagement therefore provides the entry point for the execution of many itil:ServiceOperation processes and activities. In addition, it provides a way of comparing actual performance and behavior against design standards and itil:SLA(s). As such, the itil:EventManagement process also provides a basis for service assurance and reporting, and service improvement.
