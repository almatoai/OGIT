ogit.ITIL:RequestFulfillment
	a rdfs:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf ogit:Entity;
	rdfs:label "Request Fulfillment";

	dcterms:description "The itil:RequestFulfillment is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all service requests. The term 'service request' is used as a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT department by the users. Many of these are actually small changes, low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etc. (e.g., a request to change a password, a request to install an additional software application onto a particular workstation, a request to relocate some items of desktop equipment) or maybe just a question requesting information, but their scale and frequent, low-risk nature means that they are better handled by a separate process, rather than being allowed to congest and obstruct the normal incident and change management processes. The value of itil:RequestFulfillment is to provide quick and effective access to standard services which business staff can use to improve their productivity or the quality of business services and products. The itil:RequestFulfillment process effectively reduces the bureaucracy involved in requesting and receiving access to existing or new services, thus also reducing the cost of providing these services. Centralizing fulfilment also increases the level of control over these services. This in turn can help reduce costs through centralized negotiation with suppliers, and can also help to reduce the cost of support.
