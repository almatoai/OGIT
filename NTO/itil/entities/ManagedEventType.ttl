	dcterms:description "The specific value that represents the type of monitoring and control systems used for a specific itil:Event. An effective service operation is dependent on knowing the status of the infrastructure and detecting any deviation from normal or expected operation. This is provided by good monitoring and control systems, which are based on two types of tools (note that reactive and proactive monitoring could be active or passive):  (1)  Active versus Passive Monitoring: active monitoring tools poll key CIs to determine their status and availability. Any exceptions will generate an alert that needs to be communicated to the appropriate tool or team for action. On the other hand, passive monitoring tools detect and correlate operational alerts or communications generated by CIs. (2)  Reactive versus Proactive: reactive monitoring is designed to request or trigger action following a certain type of event or failure. For example, server performance degradation may trigger a reboot, or a system failure will generate an incident. Reactive monitoring is not only used for exceptions. It can also be used as part of normal operations procedures, for example a batch job completes successfully, which prompts the scheduling system to submit the next batch job. On the other hand, proactive monitoring is used to detect patterns of events which indicate that a system or service may be about to fail. Proactive monitoring is generally used in more mature environments where these patterns have been detected previously, often several times. Proactive monitoring tools are therefore a means of automating the experience of seasoned IT staff and are often created through the proactive problem management process. Generally, it is better to manage IT services proactively, but achieving this is not easily planned or achieved.";
