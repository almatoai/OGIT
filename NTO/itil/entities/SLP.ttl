	dcterms:description "An itil:SLP is a defined level of utility and warranty for a particular itil:ServicePackage. Each itil:SLP is designed to meet the needs of a particular itil:PBA. In other words, itil:SLP(s) are effective in developing itil:ServicePackage(s) for providing value to a segment of users with utility and warranty appropriate to their needs and in a cost-effective way. Utility is the functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need. Utility is often summarized as 'what it does'. Warranty is a promise or guarantee that a product or service will meet its agreed requirements. Warranty is often summarized as 'how well it does it'. The itil:SLP(s) are associated with a set of service levels, pricing policies, and a service package. Combinations of itil:ServicesPackage(s) and itil:SLP(s) are used to serve customer segments with differentiated value. Common attributes of itil:SLP(s) are subsumed into the supporting itil:ServicePackage(s). This is like the popular game of Tetris in which the bottom-most layer of bricks gets subsumed when all its gaps are filled with the falling bricks. This follows the principle of modularity to reduce complexity, increase asset utilization across itil:SLP(s), and to reduce the overall cost of services. The itil:ServicePackage(s) and itil:SLP(s) are loosely coupled to allow for local optimization while maintaining efficiency over the entire supported service catalog. Improvements made to itil:ServicePackage(s) are automatically available to all itil:SLP(s) following the principle of inheritance and encapsulation.  The itil:ServicePackage(s) and itil:SLP(s) are each made up of reusable components many of which themselves can be services. Other components include software applications, hardware, licenses, third-party services and public infrastructure services. Some service components are assets owned by customers.";
