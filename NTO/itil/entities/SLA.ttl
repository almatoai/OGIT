	dcterms:description "An itil:SLA is a written agreement between an itil:ITServiceProvider and the itil:Customer(s), defining the key service targets and responsibilities of both parties. That is, an itil:SLA describes the itil:ITService, itil:ServiceLevelTarget(s), and specifies the responsibilities of the itil:ITServiceProvider and the itil:Customer. A single itil:SLA may cover multiple itil:ITService(s) or multiple itil:Customer(s).  The emphasis must be on agreement, and itil:SLA(s) should not be used as a way of holding one side or the other to ransom. A true partnership should be developed between the itil:ITServiceProvider and the itil:Customer, so that a mutually beneficial agreement is reached, otherwise the itil:SLA could quickly fall into disrepute and a 'blame culture' could develop that would prevent any true service quality improvements from taking place. The itil:SLA(s) provide the basis for managing the relationship between the itil:ITServiceProvider and the itil:Customer. There are a number of potential options for itil:SLA(s): (1) Service-based SLA: This is where an itil:SLA covers one service, for all the customers of that service. For example, an itil:SLA may be established for an organization's e-mail service covering all the customers of that service. This may appear fairly straightforward. However, difficulties may arise if the specific requirements of different customers vary for the same service, or if characteristics of the infrastructure mean that different service levels are inevitable (for example, head office staff may be connected via a high-speed LAN, while local offices may have to use a lower-speed WAN line). In such cases, separate targets may be needed within the one agreement. Difficulties may also arise in determining who should be the signatories to such an agreement. However, where common levels of service are provided across all areas of the business, for example, e-mail or telephony, the service-based SLA can be an efficient approach to use. Multiple classes of service, for example, gold, silver and bronze, can also be used to increase the effectiveness of service-based SLAs; (2) Customer-based SLA: This is an agreement with an individual customer group, covering all the services they use. For example, agreements may be reached with an organization's finance department covering, say, the finance system, the accounting system, the payroll system, the billing system, the procurement system, and any other IT systems that they use. Customers often prefer such an agreement, as all of their requirements are covered in a single document. Only one signatory is normally required, which simplifies this issue. A combination of either of these structures might be appropriate, providing all services and customers are covered, with no overlap or duplication. (3) Multi-level SLAs: Some organizations have chosen to adopt a multi-level SLA structure. For example, a three-layer structure as follows: * Corporate level: covering all the generic SLM issues appropriate to every customer throughout the organization. These issues are likely to be less volatile, so updates are less frequently required. * Customer level: covering all SLM issues relevant to the particular customer group or business unit, regardless of the service being used. * Service level: covering all SLM issues relevant to the specific service, in relation to a specific customer group (one for each itil:ITService covered by the itil:SLA).";
