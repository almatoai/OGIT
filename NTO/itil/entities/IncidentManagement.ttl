	dcterms:description "The itil:FinancialManagement process provides the business and IT with the quantification, in financial terms, of the value of IT Services, the value of the assets underlying the provisioning of those services, and the qualification of operational forecasting. Talking about IT in terms of services is the crux of changing the perception of IT and its value to the business. Therefore, a significant portion of itil:FinancialManagement process is working in tandem with IT and the business to help identify, document and agree on the value of the services being received, and the enablement of service demand modeling and management. The itil:FinancialMangement process is responsible for managing an IT service provider's budgeting, accounting and charging requirements. The itil:FinancialManagement process as a strategic tool is equally applicable to all three service provider types. Internal service providers are increasingly asked to operate with the same levels of financial visibility and accountability as their business unit and external counterparts. Moreover, technology and innovation have become the core revenue-generating capabilities of many companies:  * Type I - Internal service provider: Type I providers are typically business functions embedded within the business units they serve. The business units themselves may be part of a larger enterprise or parent organization. Business functions such as finance, administration, logistics, human resources, and IT provide services required by various parts of the business. They are funded by overheads and are required to operate strictly within the mandates of the business. Type I providers have the benefit of tight coupling with their owner-customers, avoiding certain costs and risks associated with conducting business with external parties. * Type II - Shared Services Unit: Functions such as finance, IT, human resources, and logistics are not always at the core of an organization's competitive advantage. Hence, they need not be maintained at the corporate level where they demand the attention of the chief executive's team. Instead, the services of such shared functions are consolidated into an autonomous special unit called a Shared Services Unit (SSU). This model allows a more devolved governing structure under which SSU can focus on serving business units as direct customers. SSU can create, grow, and sustain an internal market for their services and model themselves along the lines of service providers in the open market. Like corporate business functions, they can leverage opportunities across the enterprise and spread their costs and risks across a wider base. Unlike corporate business functions, they have fewer protections under the banner of strategic value and core competence. They are subject to comparisons with external service providers whose business practices, operating models and strategies they must emulate and whose performance they should approximate if not exceed. Performance gaps are justified through benefits received through services within their domain of control. * Type III - External service provider: The business strategies of customers sometimes require capabilities readily available from a Type III provider. The additional risks that Type III providers assume over Type I and Type II are justified by increased flexibility and freedom to pursue opportunities. Type III providers can offer competitive prices and drive down unit costs by consolidating demand. Certain business strategies are not adequately served by internal service providers such as Type I and Type II. Customers may pursue sourcing strategies requiring services from external providers. The motivation may be access to knowledge, experience, scale, scope, capabilities, and resources that are either beyond the reach of the organization or outside the scope of a carefully considered investment portfolio. Business strategies often require reductions in the asset base, fixed costs, operational risks, or the redeployment of financial assets. Competitive business environments often require customers to have flexible and lean structures. In such cases it is better to buy services rather than own and operate the assets necessary to execute certain business functions and processes. For such customers, Type III is the best choice for a given set of services. The experience of such providers is not limited to any one enterprise or market. The breadth and depth of such experience is often the single most distinctive source of value for customers. The breadth comes from serving multiple types of customers or markets. The depth comes from serving multiples of the same type. As a counter-balance, Type III providers mitigate a type of risk inherent to Types I and II: business functions and shared service units are subject to the same system of risks as their business unit or enterprise parent. This sets up a vicious cycle, whereby risks faced by the business units or the enterprise are transferred to the service units and then fed back with amplification through the services utilized. Customers may reduce systemic risks by transferring them to external service providers who spread those risks across a larger value network. Like its business equivalent, itil:FinancialManagement responsibilities and activities do not exist solely within the IT finance and accounting domain. Rather, many parts of the enterprise interact to generate and consume IT financial information, including operations and support units, project management organizations, application development, infrastructure, change management, business units, end users etc. These entities aggregate, share and maintain the financial data they need. The financial management data used by an IT organization may reside in, and be owned by the accounting and finance domain, but responsibility for generating and utilizing it extends to other areas. The itil:FinancialManagement process is a key input to the itil:ServicePortfolioManagement. By understanding cost structures applied in the provisioning of an IT service, an organization can benchmark that service cost against other IT service providers. In this way, organizations can use IT financial information, together with service demand and internal capability information to make beneficial decisions regarding whether a certain service should be provisioned internally. For example, if an organization identifies its internal cost of providing Service A to be 80EUR per month per user, and then finds a provider with the economics of scale and the focused skill set required to offer the identical service for 55EUR per month, the organization may decide that it would rather focus its resources on other IT services where it possesses a greater ability to offer lower cost and/or higher quality, and to outsource Service A to the other IT service provider. The itil:FinancialManagement process provides key inputs for Service Provisioning Optimization (SPO). SPO examines the financial inputs and constraints of service components or delivery models to determine if alternatives should be explored relating to how a service can be provisioned differently to make it more competitive in terms of cost or quality.  One goal of itil:FinancialManagement is to ensure proper funding for the delivery and consumption of services. Planning provides financial translation and qualification of expected future demand for IT Services. Financial management planning departs from historical IT planning by focusing on demand and supply variances resulting from business strategy, capacity inputs and forecasting, rather than traditional individual line item expenditures or business cost accounts. As with planning for any other business organization, input should be collected from all areas of the IT organization and the business. Planning can be categorized into three main areas, each representing financial results that are required for continued visibility and service valuation: * Operating and Capital (general and fixed asset ledgers) * Demand (need and use of IT services) * Regulatory and Environmental (compliance). The itil:FinancialManagement provides the shared analytical models and knowledge used throughout an enterprise in order to assess the expected value and/or return of a given initiative, solution, program or project in a standardized fashion. It sets the thresholds that guide the organization in determining what level of analytical sophistication is to be applied to various projects based on size, scope, resources, cost and related parameters. Accounting within itil:FinancialManagement differs from traditional accounting in that additional category and characteristics must be defined that enable the identification and tracking of service-oriented expense or capital items. The itil:FinancialManagement process plays a translational role between corporate financial systems and service management. The result of a service-oriented accounting function is that far greater detail and understanding is achieved regarding service provisioning and consumption, and the generation of data that feeds directly into the planning process. The functions and accounting characteristics that come into play are discussed below: * Service recording: the assignment of a cost entry to the appropriate service. Depending on how services are defined, and the granularity of the definitions, there may be additional sub-service components. * Cost Types: these are higher level expenses categories such as hardware, software, labor, administration, etc. These attributes assist with reporting and analyzing demand and usage of services and their components in commonly used financial terms. * Cost classifications: there are also classifications within services that designate the end purpose of the cost. These include classifications such as: - Capital/operational: this classification addresses different accounting methodologies that are required by the business and regulatory agencies. - Direct/indirect: this designation determines whether a cost will be assigned directly or indirectly to a consumer or service. - Direct costs are charged directly to a service since it is the only consumer of the expense. - Indirect or 'shared' costs are allocated across multiple services since each service may consume a portion of the expense. - Fixed/variable: this segregation of costs is based on contractual commitments of time or price. The strategic issue around this classification is that the business should seek to optimize fixed service costs and minimize the variable in order to maximize predictability and stability. - Cost Units: a cost unit is the identified unit of consumption that is accounted for a particular service or service asset. Variable Cost Dynamics (VCD) within itil:FinancialManagement focuses on analyzing and understanding the multitude of variables that impact service cost, how sensitive those elements are to variability, and the related incremental value changes that result. Among other benefits, VCD analysis can be used to identify a marginal change in unit cost resulting from adding or subtracting one or more incremental units of a service. Such an analysis is helpful when applied toward the analysis of expected impacts from events such as acquisitions, divestitures, changes to the service portfolio or service provisioning alternatives etc. On the other hand, funding addresses the financial impacts from changes to current and future demand for IT services and the way in which IT will retain the funds to continue operations. There are various traditional models for the funding of IT services. Since each model assumes a different perspective, yet rests on the same financial data, an increased ability to generate the requisite information translates to increased visibility into service costs and perceived value. The model chosen should always take into account and be appropriate for the current business culture and expectations: * Rolling Plan Funding: In a rolling plan, as one cycle completes another cycle of funding is added. This plan encourages a constant cycle of funding. However, it only addresses timing and does not necessarily increase accuracy. This type of model for funding would work well with an itil:ServiceLifecycle treatment where a commitment to fund a service is made at the beginning of the lifecycle and rolls until changes are made or the lifecycle has ended. * Trigger-Based Plans: Trigger-based funding occurs when identified critical triggers occur and set off planning for a particular event. For example, the itil:ChangeManagement process would be a trigger to the planning process for all approved changes that have financial impacts. Another trigger might be capacity planning where insight into capacity variances would affect the financial translation of IT services. This type of planning alleviates timing issues with accounting for past events, since the process requires future planning at the time of the change. It would be a good plan to use with portfolio service management since it deals with services on a lifecycle basis. * Zero-Based Funding: This funding refers to how funding of IT occurs. Funding is only enough to bring the balance of the IT financial centre back to zero or to bring the balance of the funding of a service back to zero until another funding cycle. This equates to funding only the actual costs to deliver the IT services. Finally, a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) seeks to identify a company's most critical business services through analysis of outage severity translated into a financial value, coupled with operational risk. This information can help shape and enhance operational performance by enabling better decision making regarding prioritization of incident handling, problem management focus, change and release management operations, project priority, and so on. It is a beneficial tool for identifying the cost of service outage to a company, and the relative worth of a service. These two concepts are not identical. The cost of service outage is a financial value placed on a specific service, and is meant to reflect the value of lost productivity and revenue over a specific period of time. The worth of a service relative to other services in a portfolio may not result exclusively from financial characteristics. Service Value is derived from characteristics that may go beyond itil:FinancialManagement, and represent aspects such as the ability to complete work or communicate with customers that may not be directly related to revenue generation. Both of these elements can be identified to a very adequate degree by the use of a BIA. This class represents the original Individual http://wwwvs.cs.hs-rm.de/itil#IncidentManagement.";
