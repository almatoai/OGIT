	dcterms:description "The itil:ServicePortfolioManagement process responsible for managing the itil:ServicePortfolio. An itil:ServicePortfolio describes a provider's services in terms of business value. It articulates business needs and the provider's response to those needs. By definition, business value terms correspond to marketing terms, providing a means for comparing service competitiveness across alternative providers. By acting as the basis of a decision framework, a service portfolio either clarifies or helps to clarify the following strategic questions: * Why should a customer buy these services? * Why should they buy these services from us? * What are the pricing or chargeback models? * What are our strengths and weaknesses, priorities and risk? * How should our resources and capabilities be allocated? The itil:ServicePortfolioManagement considers services in terms of the business value that they provide. The itil:ServicePortfolioManagement is a dynamic method for governing investments in service management across the enterprise and managing them for value. The operative word is method. Often the term portfolio is marginalized to a list of services, applications, assets or projects. A portfolio is essentially a group of investments that share similar characteristics. They are grouped by size, discipline or strategic value. There are few fundamental differences between IT portfolio management, project portfolio management and service portfolio management (SPM). All are enabling techniques for governance. The difference is in the implementation details. As a dynamic and ongoing process set, the itil:ServicePortfolioManagement should include the following work methods: * Define: inventory services, ensure business cases and validate portfolio data * Analyze: maximize portfolio value, align and prioritize and balance supply and demand * Approve: finalize proposed portfolio, authorize services and resources * Charter: communicate decisions, allocate resources and charter services.
