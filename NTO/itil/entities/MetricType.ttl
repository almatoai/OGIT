	dcterms:description "The specific value that represents the type of a specific itil:Metric. There are three types of metrics that an organization will need to collect to support CSI activities as well as other process activities. The types of metrics are: (1) Technology metrics: these metrics are often associated with component and application based metrics such as performance, availability etc. (2) Process metrics: these metrics are captured in the form of CSFs, KPIs and activity metrics for the service management processes. These metrics can help determine the overall health of a process. Four key questions that KPIs can help answer are around quality, performance, value and compliance of following the process. CSI would use these metrics as input in identifying improvement opportunities for each process. (3) Service metrics: these metrics are the results of the end-to-end service. Component/technology metrics are used to compute the service metrics. Also, there are four types of metrics that can be used to measure the capability and performance of processes: (1) Progress: milestones and deliverables in the capability of the process. (2) Compliance: compliance of the process to governance requirements, regulatory requirements and compliance of people to the use of the process. (3) Effectiveness: the accuracy and correctness of the process and its ability to deliver the 'right result.' (4) Efficiency: the productivity of the process, its speed, throughput and resource utilization.";
