	dcterms:description "The itil:CapacityManagement is the process responsible for ensuring that the capacity of IT services and the IT infrastructure is able to deliver agreed service level targets in a cost effective and timely manner. The itil:CapacityManagement process considers all resources required to deliver the IT service, and plans for short-, medium- and long-term business requirements. The purpose of itil:CapacityManagement is to provide a point of focus and management for all capacity- and performance-related issues, relating to both services and resources. The itil:CapacityManagement process provides the necessary information on current and planned resource utilization of individual components to enable IT service providers to decide, with confidence: * Which components to upgrade: i.e. more memory, faster storage devices, faster processors, greater bandwidth. * When to upgrade: ideally this is not too early, resulting in expensive overcapacity, nor too late, failing to take advantage of advances in new technology, resulting in bottle-necks, inconsistent performance and, ultimately, customer dissatisfaction and lost business opportunities. * How much the upgrade will cost: the forecasting and planning elements of the itil:CapacityManagement process feed into budgetary lifecycles, ensuring planned investment. The Capacity Management Information System (CMIS) is the cornerstone of a successful itil:CapacityManagement process. Information contained within the CMIS is stored and analyzed by all the subprocesses of itil:CapacityManagement because it is a repository that holds a number of different types of data, including business, service, resource or utilization and financial data, from all areas of technology. However, the CMIS is unlikely to be a single database, and probably exists in several physical locations. Data from all areas of technology, and all components that make up the IT services, can then be combined for analysis and provision of technical and management reporting. Only when all of the information is integrated can 'end-to-end' service reports be produced. The integrity and accuracy of the data within the CMIS needs to be carefully managed. If the CMIS is not part of an overall Configuration Management System (CMS) or Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS), then links between these systems need to be implemented to ensure consistency and accuracy of the information recorded within them. The information in the CMIS is used to form the basis of performance and capacity management reports and views that are to be delivered to customers, IT management and technical personnel. Also, the data is used to generate future capacity forecasts and allow itil:CapacityManagement to plan for future capacity requirements. Often a Web interface is provided to the CMIS to provide the different access and views required outside of the itil:CapacityManagement process itself. The full range of data types stored within the CMIS is as follows: * Business data: The business data is used to forecast and validate how changes in business drivers affect the capacity and performance of the IT infrastructure. Business data should include business transactions or measurements such as the number of accounts, the number of invoices generated, the number of product lines. * Service data: To achieve a service-orientated approach to the itil:CapacityManagement process, service data should be stored within the CMIS. Typical service data are transaction response times, transaction rates, workload volumes, etc. In general, the itil:SLA(s) and Service Level Requirements (itil:SLR(s)) provide the service targets for which the itil:CapacityManagement process needs to record and monitor data. To ensure that the targets in the itil:SLA(s) are achieved, Service Level Management (SLM) thresholds should be included, so that the monitoring activity can measure against these service thresholds and raise exception warnings and reports before service targets are breached. * Component utilization data: The CMIS also needs to record resource data consisting of utilization, threshold and limit information on all of the technological components supporting the services. Most of the IT components have limitations on the level to which they should be used. Beyond this level of utilization, the resource will be over-utilized and the performance of the services using the resource will be impaired. For example, the maximum recommended level of utilization on a processor could be 80%, or the utilization of a shared Ethernet LAN segment should not exceed 40%.  Also, components have various physical limitations beyond which greater connectivity or use is impossible. For example, the maximum number of connections through an application or a network gateway is 100, or a particular type of disk has a physical capacity of 15 Gb. The CMIS should therefore contain, for each component and the maximum performance and capacity limits, current and past utilization rates and the associated component thresholds. Over time this can require vast amounts of data to be accumulated, so there need to be good techniques for analyzing, aggregating and archiving this data. * Financial data: The itil:CapacityManagement process requires financial data. For evaluating alternative upgrade options, when proposing various scenarios in the capacity plan, the financial cost of the upgrades to the components of the IT infrastructure, together with information about the current IT hardware budget, must be known and included in the considerations. Most of this data may be available from the Financial Management for IT services process (itil:FinancialManagement), but the itil:CapacityManagement process needs to consider this information when managing the future business requirements.
