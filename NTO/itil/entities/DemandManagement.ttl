	dcterms:description "The itil:DemandManagement process represents the activities that understand and influence customer demand for services and the provision of capacity to meet these demands. At a strategic level, itil:DemandManagement can involve analysis of PBAs and UPs. At a tactical level it can involve use of differential charging to encourage customers to use IT services at less busy times.  The itil:DemandManagement process is a critical aspect of service management. Poorly managed demand is a source of risk for service providers because of uncertainty in demand. Excess capacity generates cost without creating value that provides a basis for cost recovery. Customers are reluctant to pay for idle capacity unless it has value for them. Business processes are the primary source of demand for services. PBAs influence the demand patterns seen by the service providers. It is very important to study the customer's business to identify, analyze and codify such patterns to provide sufficient basis for Capacity Management. Visualize the customer's business activity and plans in terms of the demand for supporting services. For example, the fulfillment of a purchase order (business activity) may result in a set of requests (demand) generated by the order-to-cash process (business process of customer). Analyzing and tracking the activity patterns of the business process makes it possible to predict demand for services in the catalogue that support the process. It is also possible to predict demand for underlying service assets that support those services. Every additional unit of demand generated by business activity is allocated to a unit of service capacity.
