	dcterms:description "An itil:OLA is an agreement between an itil:ITServiceProvider and a third party that assists with the provision of itil:ITService(s) to itil:Customer(s). However, in this case, the third party is another part of the same itil:Organization. In ITIL, a third party is a person, group, or business who is not part of an itil:SLA for an itil:ITService, but is required to ensure successful delivery of that itil:ITService (e.g., a software supplier, a hardware maintenance company, or a facilities department). The itil:OLA defines the goods or services to be provided and the responsibilities of both parties. For example there could be an itil:OLA: (i) between the itil:ITServiceProvider and a facilities department that maintains the air conditioning; (ii) between the itil:ITServiceProvider and the network support team that supports the network service; (iii) between the itil:ITServiceProvider and a procurement department to obtain hardware in agreed times; and (iv) between the itil:SERVICE_DESK (itil:RoleType instance) and an itil:SupportGroup to provide itil:Incident resolution in agreed times. An itil:OLA should contain targets that underpin those within an itil:SLA to ensure that targets will not be breached by failure of the supporting activity. In other words, an itil:OLA is any underpinning agreement necessary to deliver the quality of service agreed within the itil:SLA.";
