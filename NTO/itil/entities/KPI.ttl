	dcterms:description "An itil:KPI is an itil:Metric that is used to help manage an itil:Process, itil:ITService or itil:Activity. Many metrics may be measured, but only the most important of these are defined as itil:KPI(s) and used to actively manage and report on the process, IT service or activity. The itil:KPI(s) should be selected to ensure that efficiency, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness are all managed. Also, the provision of itil:KPI(s) is essential to supporting itil:CSI. The itil:KPI(s) are used to provide a basis for actionable management decisions. Each itil:KPI is trying to answer a question. While itil:OperationalMetric(s) are generally historical in nature, itil:KPI(s) are really the \"metrics that matter.\" These itil:KPI(s) become the data inputs to analyze and identify improvement opportunities. For example, 'Increasing first-contact resolution' is a common itil:KPI for the itil:IncidentManagement process. In order to compute the itil:KPI, we must identify the metrics and measurements required. There are two basic kinds of itil:KPI, qualitative and quantitative. '10 percent increase in customer satisfaction rating for handling incidents over the next 6 months' is an example of a qualitative itil:KPI that requires the metrics 'Original customer satisfaction score for handling incidents' and 'Ending customer satisfaction score for handling incidents', and the measurements 'Incident handling survey score' and 'Number of survey scores.' On the other hand, '10 percent reduction in the costs of handling printer incidents' is an example of quantitative itil:KPI that requires the metrics 'Original cost of handling a printer incidents', 'Final cost of handling a printer incidents' and 'Cost of the improvement effort', and the measurements 'Time spent on the incident by first-level operative and their average salary', 'Time spent on the incident by second-level operative and their average salary', 'Time spent on Problem Management activities by second-level operative and their average salary', 'Time spent on the training first-level operative on the workaround', 'Cost of a service call to third-party vendor' and 'Time and material from third-party vendor.' Note that all itil:KPI(s) require calculation. The itil:CapacityManagement process, for example, is an itil:OperationalMetric (observed from a process audit) and simply carries over as an itil:KPI.";
