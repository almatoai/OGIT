		but may be executable in the future and/or on other resources.
		For example, in OSLC Automation this is expected to link from an oslc_auto:AutomationPlan to an
		oslc:Action resource with zero bindings (as it is not executable),
		with the meaning that the executable form of the action may be available on oslc_auto:AutomationResult resources
		generated by executing that Automation Plan.  Similarly, resource shapes can allow discovery of actions
		available on the output of a creation factory.
