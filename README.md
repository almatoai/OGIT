# Welcome to the _Open Graph of IT_ Ontology

## Overview

_Open Graph of IT_ (OGIT) aims to build a semantic representation of all IT and its interaction with business processes and people.
Such an endeavour requires a sound data space as a foundation for computational evaluation of this enterprise space.
OGIT aims to become the 'IT version' of **Google's Knowledge Graph** or Facebook's **Social Graph**.
Hence we need a common language for IT entities and relationships between them.

OGIT aims to provide a such common language by defining an ontology for the _Graph of IT_.

The OGIT project is not only a hosting place for a specification. It also
provides a platform for domain experts to contribute to the ontology.
One of the basic principles is: _evolution over standardization_.

## GraphIT Documentation

There is an application called [GraphIT](https://graphit.co) that allows you to
manage IT data through a RESTful API ensuring compliance to the OGIT ontology.

The following links provide more information on OGIT and GraphIT.

## Updating the Local GraphIT Ontology

Once OGIT master branch is updated, the changes are automatically built and pushed every hour to
https://graphit.co/schemas/graphit-ontology.yaml

To update ogit ontology on local GraphIT installation, please run:

```
cd ~
wget https://graphit.co/schemas/graphit-ontology.yaml
/opt/autopilot/setup/helpers/load_ontology ~/graphit-ontology.yaml
```

To ensure that all changes are correctly loaded you may restart GraphIT:
```
/opt/autopilot/admin/start-autopilot.sh -r graphit
```
